# About

This repository showcases a demo Android application developed using `Android Studio`. The application is a calculator app, created as an example for Android app development. The development of this application involved the use of `Kotlin` and `Java` libraries.

Some experimental features have been implemented, including:

- Day and Night Mode
- Item options on the Menu Bar
- Opening a new window from items in the Menu Bar
- Auto Scientific Mode on Landscape Mode
- Dialogue Box and Radio Buttons

Please note that this project is an experimental self-developed project. While developing the project, some guidance was taken from YouTube tutorials.

3. Add the `MathParser.org-mXparser.jar` library to the `"Calculator_Updated -> app -> libs"` directory.
4. Right-click on the `libs` folder, select "Add As Library" from the menu, and click "OK".

# Caution
