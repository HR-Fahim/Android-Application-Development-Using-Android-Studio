# About
A demo of Android App-Development using `Android-Studio`. Here, a calculator application has been developed as a demo android application. `Kotlin` & `Java` library have been used to develop this application.
Experimental features have used in this application, such as:
- Day & Night Mode.
- `Item` options on `Menu-Bar`.
- Opening a new Window from `Items` in `Menu-bar`.
- Auto Scientific Mode on Landscape Mode.
- Dialogue Box & Radio Buttons.

<sub> ****P.S.*** Experimental Self-developed project (Although, Youtube tutorial supports have taken while developing the project).*<sub/>

# Requirements
- `Android-Studio`<br />
# Installation
1. Unzip the `Calculator_Final.rar` and put the `Calculator_Upated` folder inside `"/home/USER/Projects/AndroidStudio"` or you can open it from `Android-Studio`. To open it from `Anroid-Studio`, select `file` from menu and select `open`. Next, choose the `Calculator_Updated` folder.
2. You will have to add the `MathParser.org-mXparser.jar` library inside `"Calculator_Upated -> app -> libs"`.
3. Then select `libs` folder; right click and select `Add As Library` from menu; select `ok`.
# Caution
- The project was tested on `Pixel 2 XL API 22-1440x2880 560dpi/Android 5.1 x86 (Emulator)`. It can create problems with different versions of `Android-Emulators`.<br />
- Error values show as `NaN` on Calculator.<br />
- The values come always as fraction value by default.<br />

Except for this, there are not any known bugs till now. If facing any issues, let me know or contact me.
